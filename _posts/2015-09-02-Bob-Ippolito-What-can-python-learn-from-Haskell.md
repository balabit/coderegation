What can we learn from Erlang or Haskell for building reliable high concurrency services? Bob was involved in many Python projects but argues that for some domains there may be better methods found elsewhere. He started looking for alternatives back in 2006 when building high concurrency services at Mochi Media (originally with Twisted), which led him to the land of Erlang and later Haskell. Bob is going to talk about what he learned along the way. In particular, he'll cover some techniques that are used in functional programming languages and how they can be used to solve problems in more performant, robust and/or concise ways than the standard practices in Python. He is also going to discuss some potential ways that the Python language and its library ecosystem could evolve accordingly.
