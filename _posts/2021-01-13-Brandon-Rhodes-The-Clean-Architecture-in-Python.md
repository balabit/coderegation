Python programmers already use many design patterns in their work. Each pattern distills the wisdom the community has learned over the years, often at great expense, and makes it available to younger programmers. But even design-conscious programmers often find their applications growing more difficult to test and expand. In this talk, we will learn about how the recently propounded “Clean Architecture” applies to Python applications, and how this high-level design pattern fits particularly well with the features of the Python language.
