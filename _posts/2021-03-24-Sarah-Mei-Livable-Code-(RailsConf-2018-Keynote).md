The modern practice of software isn't much like architecture or construction. The buildings are largely built. These days, we make a pre-built space work for whoever lives there.

Ever been to a staged house? They hire interior designers to put furniture, rugs, etc. into the space, so people can imagine themselves there, and it's not just empty.

Staged houses are beautiful. They're designed to make you go "WOW" when you walk in, and think, "I could live like this."

But you can't actually live in a staged house. They leave out lots of things that make a space more cluttered, but also make it work.
