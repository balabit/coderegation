Target audience:
Developers who are interested in seeing Haskell being used as a general programming language. Engineers who are hoping to see Haskell as an environment in which they can quickly and effectively iterate between requirements, design and running executable code: providing value to the business with an immediate feedback loop.

Pre-requirements:

 * basic understanding of Haskell syntax
 * basic FP building blocks: functor, monad

Topics explored:

 * software architecture
 * software testability and maintainability
 * Free Monads
 * Polysemy library
