Gilad Bracha explains how to distinguish FP hype from reality and to apply key
ideas of FP in non-FP languages, separating the good parts of FP from its
unnecessary cultural baggage.

Discussion
----------
After watching the video, we've discussed a lot about monads and effective
approaches to understanding them. We started to converge on the thought that
they may be the tissue which connects the abstract algebra part of the brain to
the sockets and syslog and networking etc. part. Maybe it's worth learning
Haskell even if one doesn't plan to use it on a daily basis, just to make it
easier to get involved in functional programming related discussions.
