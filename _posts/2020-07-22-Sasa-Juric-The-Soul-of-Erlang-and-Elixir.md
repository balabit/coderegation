Whether you're developing a small web site or a large-scale distributed system, Erlang and Elixir are great tools for building server-side systems. Both languages can help you start quickly and deal with highly complex problems at a large scale.

This talk aims to explain what makes Erlang and Elixir suitable for such tasks. We'll look past the syntax and the ecosystem, focusing instead on the concurrency model of these languages.

Combining a bit of high-level theory and a couple of demos, we'll examine some important properties of Erlang/Elixir concurrency, with a special emphasis on why these properties are very relevant when building highly available systems.

A really impressive demonstration of the robustness and runtime debuggability of the BEAM virtual machine.
