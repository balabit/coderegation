Since commercialization and privatization of the Internet first began in the 1990's, there has been a steady push to move access side DNS (called "recursive") away from customer networks and towards first ISP's and later Cisco, Google, IBM, and Cloudflare. What are the real motives for this trend? What are the risks and costs, and who pays them? Dr. Vixie has worked in the DNS field since 1989 and has invented many of the monitoring and filtering capabilities now used by nearly all DNS services, and he will try to explain what's happening. Special attention will be paid to the new web-based "DNS over HTTP" or "DoH" protocol now being strongly pushed by Mozilla and others. 

Discussion
----------
There were more participants than usual this time, and the talk sparked a rather interesting conversation both about DNS security in general, and regarding our internal systems.
